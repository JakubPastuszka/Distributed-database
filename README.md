# Distributed-database
project was made in java 1.8 version


how to ownload and run


1. Select “Download ZIP”.
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer, e.g., BazaJava.
3. Open Terminal / Command Prompt
  On Windows: open Command Prompt.
  On Linux/macOS: open Terminal.
  Navigate to the folder where you extracted the ZIP. Example:
  cd ~/Downloads/BazaJava-main  # or the correct path where you extracted it
4. Compile the Java Files
Make sure you have Java JDK installed. Then compile the two files:
javac DatabaseNode.java
javac DatabaseClient.java
  (This will create two .class files in the same folder.)

First, run the server (DatabaseNode):
java DatabaseNode
(for every new DataBase node make new terminal window)

In a new terminal or command prompt window, navigate to the same folder and run the client:
java DatabaseClient
